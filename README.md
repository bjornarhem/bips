# bips

Script for automatically scheduling interviews for volunteer positions in UKA.
Doesn't work on its own, as it's part of a larger django application; just an example of some code I've written.
Maybe also useful as an example for others trying to do the same thing?

Was used in UKA-19, and scheduled most of the interviews for UKAs ~2000 volunteers.
